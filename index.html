        Hi! I'm octo-otaku, but you can call me Yuri! On this blog, I'm gonna post my art and writing about whatever I happen to be fixated on at the moment. Expect my writing to vary from perfect capitalization to missing apostrophes and lowercase i's everywhere depending on my mood and also have a lot  of notes written in parentheses. (Um my capitalization is normal when I'm writing fics and stuff don't worry)
      </div>
        My interests include Splatoon, The Amazing Digital Circus, Miku/Vocaloid, Project Sekai, My Hero Academia, and SpyxFamily. (I've also been kinda into Dandy's World lately but I'm hesitant to add it to the list of things that I really really like because I've only recently gotten into it.)

        Some of the stuff I hope to add to this site in the future includes: getting all of my previous daily drawings onto here, adding a section where people can message me with their thoughts or commisions (which I do want to do in the future), post more digital stuff (tho that might be more of a next year thing bc i wont be doing daily phyisical drawings), and adding more cute details to my site like little stars in the corner, images of Yuri (which is both what I go by online and the name of my self-insert-catgirl-former-MHA-OC-turned-future-PNG-tuber-and-digital-representation-of-myself??) on the home and about pages.
