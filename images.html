                    SO. I really like the Chirpy Chips, right? I also really want them to be the idols in Splatoon 4, so i made a bunch of custom splatfest themes for them, and i picked their teams too, and I was gonna make art and outfits for them but um it turns out i dont have the time or motivation to do that hahah 
                    But I did make waitress Paruko (um sort of. Maybe I'll do a redraw of that eventually? Yes. let's do that. Ferb, I know what we're going to draw today), which would be her outfit for the Ketchup vs. Mustard splatfest (she's on team mustard because she likes to put it in her strawberry shakes) also some of the stuff I wrote there is a lie. my updates did NOT get smaller after winter break, just bigger and more ambitious. *cries in so many post-it notes filled with lists of unfinished drawings help me please-* (Upload date: 4-8-25)

                    I wanted to draw Paul from Splatoon. I also wanted to color it, but it got pretty late, so the art and coloring were really rushed haha...
                    I also have some age headcanons for Murch (I still haven't finished writing all of Paul's lore yet, so there's definitely some gaps in there, but I want Paul and Murch to be friends) at the top of the page and some bonus acht in there because they're a really cool character hehe (thinks about my 3 pages of acht lore which is REALLY just a summary for a fanfic i wanna write hahahahAHAHAHAHAH (i dont have the time to write because im so behind ahhh)) Also, no hate to Murdoch Feeder, but also yes hate to Murdoch Feeder because i cant even remember what he looks like. that's just how forgettable he is. um sorry to any bottom feeders fans they are definitely not my favorite splatband partially because they look so hard to draw urgh (Upload date: 4-8-25)

                    The first of my daily drawings! The rules I set for myself have since changed, but the concept has remained the same. (There's no way I'm ever doing this again tho)
                    Oh yeah, the inspiration for this came from the New Year's event in Project Sekai, where we could get a New Year's fortune based off of the groups in the game. The group I got was More More Jump, so I decided to draw Minori, also one of my favorite characters ^^ (sorry for the yap-fest lol i just didnt think i explained it well enough in the drawing) Um another thing about this is that I actually didn't think I would ever have a social media platform when I wrote this initially, but um now I have my own website!
